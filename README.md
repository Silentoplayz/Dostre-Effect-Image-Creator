# Recursive-Mirror-Effect-Generator-For-Images
The Recursive Mirror Effect Generator is a Python script that applies a recursive mirror effect to an input image, creating an artistic and visually interesting result. It shrinks and pastes iterations of the image onto itself, producing a mirrored and progressively smaller pattern.
